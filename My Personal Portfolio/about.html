                <p>I am Vasco Yudha Nodyatama Sera, an enthusiastic individual from the Informatics Engineering program at Universitas Negeri Semarang. Originally from Palangka Raya, Central Kalimantan, I developed an interest in technology at a young age and began teaching myself basic programming during high school. This passion has guided my academic journey and led me to pursue a degree in Informatics Engineering at Universitas Negeri Semarang.

                    Throughout my academic career, I have consistently ranked at the top 5 of my class while balancing various extracurricular activities. This dedication earned me admission to Universitas Negeri Semarang through the SNBP pathway. My involvement in organizations such as Green School, and Duta Intelegensia has honed my leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. Leading the Green School extracurricular activities at SMAN 3 Palangka Raya allowed me to develop a strong sense of responsibility and commitment to environmental sustainability. Additionally, I am currently a member of the English Debate Society at Universitas Negeri Semarang, which helps me enhance my public speaking and critical thinking skills.
                    
                    I acknowledge that I have personal challenges, such as overcoming procrastination on certain days. Maintaining consistency in various endeavors is also a challenge for me. However, I am determined to improve by at least 1% every day, as I believe achieving meaningful results requires significant effort.
                    
                    My hobbies include reading books, video/photo editing, writing, and coding. Through these interests, I often participate in various competitions to deepen my skills. I aspire to work at leading global technology companies such as Facebook or Google, where I can contribute to innovative and cutting-edge projects. I am aware of the challenges ahead, such as time management and balancing organizational activities, but I am committed to overcoming them through perseverance and careful planning. My ultimate goal is to work on an international scale, making my family proud while contributing to technological advancements. I am always open to new opportunities and enthusiastic about connecting with like-minded professionals</p>
